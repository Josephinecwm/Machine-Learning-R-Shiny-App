# Machine Learning R Shiny app for a Portuguese Bank

This project developed two machine learning models (Decision Tree and Random Forest) to help predict customer subscription rate for a term deposit. An interactive web app (R shiny app) was also designed to present how the two models work from data input, model tuning, model accuracy, and final model presentation. Within the app, the users can experience the whole process by adjusting parameters such as the number of folds for cross-validation and the ratio for train test splits.

## Dataset
